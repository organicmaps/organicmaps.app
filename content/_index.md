**Organic Maps** is a free Android & iOS offline maps app for travelers, tourists, hikers, and cyclists based on top of crowd-sourced
**[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)** data.
It is a privacy-focused, open-source [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) of **Maps.me** app (previously known as [**MapsWithMe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps.me)), maintained by the same people who created **MapsWithMe** in 2011.

**Organic Maps** is one of a few applications nowadays that supports 100% of features without an active Internet connection. Install Organic Maps, download maps, throw away your SIM card (by the way, your operator constantly tracks you), and go for a weekly trip on a single battery charge without any byte sent to the network.
