It's probably our bug, and we will be happy to fix it in the next update.

On Android, if you store your maps on an SD card, the most likely cause is a faulty SD card. You can format your SD card, or better yet replace it with a new one. If you moved the app itself to SD card, please move it back to the internal (device) storage.

If the issue continues, please [contact us](mailto:support@organicmaps.app) and give us:

* short description of the issue
* Organic Maps version
* device model and OS version (Android or iOS).
