Please make sure your device has GPS and Location settings are activated.

**Android**

On your device open Settings → Location. It is better to switch on High accuracy mode.

If you have difficulty determining your location with GPS, enable (disable, if enabled) “Google Play Services” in the app settings.

Note: you can see it only if you have Google Play services installed (enabled) on your Android device. Google play services are used to determine location more precisely, if you experience issues with location accuracy after you disabled the option, turn it on.

**iOS**

If you are an iPhone or iPad user, please check iOS settings → Privacy → Location services. Geolocation data sharing should be enabled for Organic Maps.

**Notes:**

* To avoid unwanted data while roaming, you can turn off all mobile data, activate a flight mode or disable mobile data for Organic Maps in your device settings. Android and iOS devices can use GPS in the flight mode.

* Some mobile devices do not have built-in GPS receivers, such as the iPod Touch, WiFi-only iPad, Amazon Kindle Fire/Kindle Fire HD 7 and some Android tablets. On these devices our application will show your approximate location, as long as you are connected to the internet.

* Finally, please remember that location determining with GPS (with WiFi and Mobile Network off) may take some time. The longer the GPS has not been used, the more time it takes. The speed of location determining depends on the device, not on the app. The GPS' operation is influenced by the weather as well – it works best outdoors when the sky is clear. Problems may arise when trying to locate yourself indoors, on a narrow street or when driving a car.
