Remember that to search for a place in a specific area, you will need to download a relevant map and zoom in the map to that area, or your location should be near that area before you begin search. For example, if you want to find a place in Vietnam and your location is somewhere else, you should download and open the map of Vietnam first.

In addition, the place may not have been added to the map yet at [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), our map data source. If you want to help and improve the map, check [this guide](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contribute_map_data).

If the place is displayed on the map in Organic Maps, but our search cannot find it, [report us](mailto:support@organicmaps.app) coordinates of the place and an example of your search request.
