Your download can fail due to a temporary network error or specific network provider/router settings. Please try again later or use a different Wi-Fi access point. In addition, make sure, that you have enough free space to download maps.

On Android, please make sure that you have granted network access for Organic Maps and system Download Manager (Download Provider).

Also, if you have very outdated maps and the app can't update them, it may help to delete outdated maps and re-download them.
