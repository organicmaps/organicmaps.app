### **About**

Organic Maps is a privacy-focused and community-developed navigation app for drivers, hikers, and cyclists. The app features navigation with privacy - no location tracking, no data collection, and no ads. Search, routing and navigation operates without a cell phone signal, ideal for distant hiking trails or locations with poor connections. Organic Maps uses the crowd-sourced map data from OpenStreetMap, which has contributors all over the globe. The Organic Maps prioritizes community development and collaboration.
