### **About Organic Maps**

Organic Maps is a privacy-focused and community-developed navigation app for drivers, hikers, and cyclists. The app features ease in navigating with privacy: no location tracking, no data collection, and no ads. Search, routing and navigation operates without a cell phone signal, ideal for distant hiking trails or locations with poor connections. Organic Maps uses the crowd-sourced map data from OpenStreetMap, with contributors all over the globe, and prioritizes community development and collaboration.

### **Vision**

Create a world where traveling with maps has privacy-focus by default and the top choice on the planet. Unlock the freedom to navigate easily with privacy-focused maps, powered by the community.
