3. With your support, we want to become a better, privacy-focused version of Google Maps.

## What will the money be used for?

   - Weekly and automated map data updates
   - Bookmarks backup and sync
   - Android Auto
   - GPS track recorder with GPX support
   - Better map styles for different activities
   - Hill shading and 3D terrain

   - Better offline address search, routing, and navigation
   - Public Transport
   - … and [many other][GitHub issues] features you want and love
